Description - This is a version of a the Card Memory game. The game contains 16 cards with two sets of pairs from values 
              0-8. The objective of the game is to find the paired cards while they are hidden. Two cards are selected face
              up every turn and if they are a match, then they remain faceup otherwise they are hidden again. The goal is to
              find all 8 pairs of cards in the minimum number of turns. 

Note: This code works with codeskulptor.org and will not work with tradition Python compiler because it uses library simplegui
      which is a custom made library
